To use, make sure [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) are installed and added to the PATH environment variable. These can be obtained from:

* Node.js - http://nodejs.org/download/
* Mocha - by running `npm install -g mocha` once Node has been added to the system's path.

Then, browse to the project root directory and run:

```
npm install
npm test
```

The `npm install` command only has to be run once. After that, running `npm test` alone should be sufficient.
